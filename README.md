## ðŸ“Œ Getting Started




> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository and Start Metro

First, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/JadhaAM/WeatherApp.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```sh
cd WeatherApp
```

Then, start **Metro**, the JavaScript bundler for React Native:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Build and Run Your App

With Metro running, open a new terminal window and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app.

#### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### iOS

For iOS, install CocoaPods dependencies (only needed on first setup or after updating native dependencies):

```sh
bundle install  # Install Ruby bundler for CocoaPods
bundle exec pod install  # Install CocoaPods dependencies
```

To run the app on iOS:

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

> **Note**: Make sure you have Xcode installed and properly configured for iOS development.

If everything is set up correctly, your app should now be running on the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or a connected device.

### Step 3: Modify Your App

Now that the app is running, let's make changes!

- Open `App.tsx` in your preferred code editor.
- Make some modifications.
- Save the file, and your app will **automatically refresh** with the changes â€” thanks to [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

To force reload the app:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or open the **Dev Menu** using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in the iOS Simulator.
